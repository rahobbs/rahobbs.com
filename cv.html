            <h2> Chapter Leader / Volunteer - Girl Develop It - 2012-present </h2>
            <p> After noticing a lack of beginner-friendly tech meetups in Raleigh NC, I decided to found a local chapter of  <a href="www.girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>. Chapter leadership involved organizing classes and workshops, finding teachers, helping out during class, and planning events. Since moving to New York, I've continued volunteering as a teaching assistant, helping students learn Python, PHP, Git, Linux, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
            <h2> Technical Support Specialist - EarthSoft - 2011-Present</h2>
            <p> As a member of the Help Desk team, I support enterprise-level environmental database software and the SQL and Oracle databases it works with. This involves not only helping clients resolve issues, but also testing software and writing documentation. </p>
            <h2>Bridge and Cell Tower Inspector - FDH - 2010-2011</h2>
            <p> An unexpected position that taught a lot about working in high-pressure situations with little guidance or supervision. I traveled a lot, took many measurements, and hit a lot of different kinds of things with a lot of different kinds of hammers… and with bocce balls. </p>
