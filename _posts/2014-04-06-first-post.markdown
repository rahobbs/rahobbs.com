Finally, a website! This is something I’ve been meaning to build for some time and just never quite got around to. What started out as me wanting to brush up on my PHP (I’m acting as a teaching assistant for Girl Develop It and need to stay ahead of my students!) turned into my wondering if I should set up a local WordPress instance just to tinker with. After installing and configuring WordPress and starting on a local Nginx server to use with it, I somehow went off on a tangent of looking at available domain names, registering one, and setting up hosting. I didn’t make the progress I was hoping with PHP, but as far as tangents go this has been a productive one.
